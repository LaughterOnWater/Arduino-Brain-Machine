Derivation and Notes:
Make sure you have dual wheel potentiometer to reduce
the volume of the audio with your headset. If you don't, 
you might damage your ear drums, your arduino or your headset.

This arduino sketch is based on the original Sound & Light Machine 
by - Mitch Altman - 19-Mar-07 as featured in Make Magazine 10.

See notes in code below for how I adapted Mitch Altman's version for Arduino

The sleep coding comes partially from here:

***************************************************

I've included a Stereo Eyephone Test sketch 
and a Stereo Tone Test Sketch. These sketches are purely
for development purposes, used to confirm preferred programming
prior to putting it into the Arduino Brain Machine Sketch.

If you're having trouble with Eyephones or Earphones, try
isolating the cause using one of these simpler sketches.
