Derivation and Notes:
Make sure you have dual wheel potentiometer to reduce
the volume of the audio with your headset. If you don't, 
you might damage your ear drums, your arduino or your headset.

This arduino sketch is based on the original Sound & Light Machine

See notes in code below for how I adapted Mitch Altman's version for Arduino

The sleep coding comes partially from here:
